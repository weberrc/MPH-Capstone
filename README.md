## Abstract:
**Background**: Gun violence in New York city has been in decline since the 1990s. In January 2013, following the Sandy Hook shooting, the State of New York passed the SAFE Act. This comprehensive legislation sought to reduce gun-violence state-wide. Knowing that incidence of gun violence can be impacted by many factors, it is important to assess the existence of benefit resulting from this legislation.

**Methods**: We conducted interrupted time series negative binomial regression to predict the number of shootings to occur on a single day and single month given prior trends, to infer from the impact legislative action had on the probability of a shooting-free weekend. We also accounted for day of the week and month to accommodate temporal trends in gun violence.

**Results**: Gun violence in New York City has declined by about 2% each year since 2006. SAFE Act passage reduced incidence of gun-violence by 14% at the day level and 13% at the month level. Day of the week was a significant predictor of expected shootings with estimates rising on weekends and falling mid-week. Monthly estimates demonstrated that shooting incidence was lowest in February and highest in July and August.

**Conclusion**: The SAFE Act positively affected gun-violence in the 6 years following its implementation. Such suggests that comprehensive gun legislation reduces gun violence.
